# HTML_sitepw

HTML_sitepw is a html script which you can add to your website, to make it password locked. The password is being saved for 12h in the users cache. After 12h (where the user didn't visit this website) the cache is being cleared and you have to re-enter the password.


# how to set up
1. add the code from "main.html" to your website
2. Change the "ENTER PASSWORD HERE" to the password you want to have for this site.


# not recomended solution
This solution isn't the best one. The password isn't saved on the server side but if you want to make a basic just for fun page, this would be a method to make a subsite password locked.
